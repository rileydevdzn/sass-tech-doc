## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Fluid typography with viewport units and the CSS `clamp()` function
- CSS variables
- CSS-only mobile hamburger menu
- Flexbox
- Responsive design


### What I learned

Positioning and making the page responsive across all sizes (position fixed, relative, absolute)
Creating a CSS-only mobile hamburger menu with underlay and slide-in mobile menu

### Continued development

 

### Useful resources

- [Alvaro Trigo responsive CSS hamburger menu](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/) - On completing my initial build of the mobile menu, I realized something was missing. This tutorial included an overlay that provides a dark background when the mobile menu slides into view, which provided a better visual than the white menu on white background.
